       <h1>Integrations</h1>

  <!--#include virtual="_menu.html" -->

       <h2>ArgoUML</h2>

<p>The OCL Toolkit has been integrated into the open-source CASE tool <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/">ArgoUML</a>. Please
have a look on <a href="argo_integration.html">an example that shows how the integration
in Argo/UML helps in working with the OCL</a>. The example also shows the code injection
with the injector tool from the Toolkit. If you want to test the example by yourself,
please refer to the download page and install the necessary files.</p>

       <h2>Poseidon</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gentleware.com">Poseidon</a> is the commercial successor of ArgoUML
and also contains the integration of the Dresden OCL Toolkit just as its
predecessor does.</p>

       <h2>Borland Together</h2>

<p>A prototypical integration into <a href="http://www.borland.de/together/index.html">Borland
Together ControlCenter</a> is available (see
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=5840">screenshot</a>). It
is currently only available through downloading the sources from the CVS repository
and building the module manually with the help of ANT scripts. Please refer to
the installation <a href="together_integration.html">step-by-step guide</a> provided.</p>

<p>Also have a look on this <a href="together_integration_usageexample.html">usage example</a> that shows how
the Toolkit can be used from within Together.</p> 

<p>The integration of the Dresden OCL Toolkit 1.3 into Borland Together ControlCenter
should work with all versions vom 6.0 upwards.</p>

       <h2>Rational Rose</h2>

<p>An integration into Rational Rose has been performed. This integration package is not
in the public domain, however.</p>
