<h1>Integrations</h1>

<!--#include virtual="_menu.html" -->

<h2>ArgoUML</h2>

<p>The Dresden OCL Toolkit has been integrated into the open-source
CASE tool <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/">ArgoUML</a>. Please have
a look on <a href="ocl_argoIntegration.html">an example that shows
how the integration in Argo/UML helps in working with the OCL</a>. The
example also shows the code injection with the injector tool from the
toolkit. If you want to test the example by yourself, please refer to
the download page and install the necessary files.</p>


<h2>Borland Together</h2>

<p>A prototypical integration into <a
	href="http://www.borland.de/together/index.html">Borland Together
ControlCenter</a> is available (see <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=5840">screenshot</a>).
It is currently only available through downloading the sources from the
CVS repository and building the module manually with the help of ANT
scripts. Please refer to the installation <a
	href="ocl_togetherIntegration.html">step-by-step guide</a> provided.</p>

<p>Also have a look on this <a
	href="ocl_togetherIntegrationUsageExample.html">usage example</a> that
shows how the Toolkit can be used from within Together.</p>

<p>The integration of the Dresden OCL Toolkit 1.3 into Borland
Together ControlCenter should work with all versions vom 6.0 upwards.</p>


<h2>Fujaba4Eclipse</h2>

<p>The Fujaba Tool Suite is developed at the university of paderborn
(<a
	href="http://wwwcs.uni-paderborn.de/cs/fujaba/projects/eclipse/index.html"
	target="blank">http://wwwcs.uni-paderborn.de/cs/fujaba/projects/eclipse/index.html</a>).
One project based on the Fujaba Tool Suite is Fujaba4Eclipse.
Fujaba4Eclipse is as an open source project and its goal is to provide
an integrated teaching environment based on Eclipse for secondary
schools and first year university courses. It should assist teaching
object-oriented technology, design patterns and the syntax and semantics
of a programming language.</p>
<p>In 2005 and 2006 Mirko St&ouml;lzel integrated parts of the
Dresden OCL2 Toolkit into Fujaba4Eclipse (for his student research
projects Gro&szlig;er Beleg and Diploma Thesis), to use OCL constraints
in class and story diagrams created with Fujaba4Eclipse.</p>

<h2>MetaBoss</h2>

<p><a href="http://metaboss.sourceforge.net/">MetaBoss</a>, a dually
licensed Model-Driven-Architecture toolkit makes use of the Dresden OCL
Toolkit for modelling of service specifications and domain entities. It
also allows generation of validation code from the OCL in a model.</p>



<h2>Poseidon</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gentleware.com">Poseidon</a> is the
commercial successor of ArgoUML and also contains the integration of the
Dresden OCL Toolkit just as its predecessor does.</p>


<h2>Rational Rose</h2>

<p>An integration into Rational Rose has been performed. This
integration package is not in the public domain, however.</p>
