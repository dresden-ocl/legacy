       <h2>What is the Dresden OCL Toolkit?</h2>

<p>The Dresden OCL Toolkit is all about the Object Constraint Language (OCL). OCL is
part of the well-known Unified Modelling Language (UML). It extends the UML's graphical
notation with the possiblity of adding more formally defined textual constraints on method
invocations and on class structures as a whole. Many aspects
of a model that cannot be expressed adequately with the graphical notation alone find
their representation in OCL constraints.</p>

<p>So, where does the Dresden OCL Toolset come into play? As its name indicates it is
not some standalone solution. Instead, many of these tools are meant to be used as a library,
integrated into other tools, but there exist also some standalone tools in the Toolkit.</p>

       <h2>Who did the work?</h2>

<p>Work on the Toolkit started as early as 1999 when the OCL base library was
first implemented in Java. Since the first version of the OCL compiler was
completed alongside a Diploma Thesis, continuous work on and around the Toolkit has
led to quite a considerable number of modules, which are now available.</p>

<p>The Toolkit is enhanced and maintained mainly by students and scientific staff
of the Software Technology Group at Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden, where the
project is also coordinated. Contribution is however not restricted to this group
so feel free to get in touch.</p>

       <h2>The different applications in the Toolkit</h2>

<p>Although this is not a stand-alone tool there is a demonstration
module coming with the Toolkit which helps to understand the way the Toolkit works.
<br/><br/>
There are seven applications in the Toolkit by now. The different demonstration modules are
listed below with some inspirational screenshots.

  <h2>1. OCL2 Workbench</h2>
  <p>This software was written by Stefan Ocke for his diploma thesis. It provides the
     following functions:
  	<ul>
     <li>loading metamodels into the repository using XMI</li>
     <li>creation of OCL invariants for loaded metamodels</li>
     <li>generating code for those invariants</li>
     <li>loading of models and execution of generated code to check for compliance
        with invariants</li>
     </ul>
  <table style="border:0px;margin:0 auto;text-align:center;font-size:9pt;">
  	<tr>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/workbench/01.gif"><img src="images/screens/workbench/01small.gif" alt="meta model and OCL script" target="e"/></a></td>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/workbench/02.gif"><img src="images/screens/workbench/02small.gif" alt="code generator" target="e"/></a></td>
    </tr><tr>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Installed meta model<br/>and OCL script</td>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Generated code</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </p>
  <h2>2. OCL2 Parser GUI</h2>
  <p>This software was written by Ansgar Konermann for his diploma thesis. It
     provides a GUI to the OCL2 parser and allows:
     <ul>
     <li>editing, loading and saving of text files containing OCL2 constraints</li>
     <li>parsing OCL2 constraints into a concrete syntax tree and visualizing
        this tree</li>
     <li>loading UML15 models
to run attribute evaluation/AST generation against (using XMI)</li>
     <li>browse UML models in the repository (very basic browsing only)</li>
     <li>running an attribute evaluator over the concrete syntax tree to create
        the abstract syntax tree</li>
     </ul>
  <table style="border:0px;margin:0 auto;text-align:center;font-size:9pt;">
  	<tr>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/parser/01.gif"><img src="images/screens/parser/01small.gif" alt="constraint input" target="e"/></a></td>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/parser/02.gif"><img src="images/screens/parser/02small.gif" alt="concrete syntax tree" target="e"/></a></td>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/parser/03.gif"><img src="images/screens/parser/03small.gif" alt="visualized concrete syntax tree" target="e"/></a></td>
    </tr><tr>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Enter OCL constraint</td>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Parsing constraint results in concrete syntax tree</td>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Visualized concrete syntax tree</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </p>

  <h2>3. OCL22SQL</h2>
  <p>This software was written as a prototype example for the OCL Declarative Code Generator
  	  by Florian Heidenreich for his diploma thesis. It provides a GUI
      to create integrity views from textual OCL invariants and allows:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>loading of OCL constraint files</li>
     <li>loading UML1.5 models to run attribute evaluation/AST generation against
         (using XMI)</li>
     <li>choosing between different object-relational mapping schemes to create
         DDL-scripts for table schemas and DDL-scripts for object views</li>
     <li>generating of SQL integrity views from the AST</li>
     </ul>
  <p>
      Please note, that this tool doesn't support association classes and OCL
      constraints which use the class names instead of association ends for
      navigation.
  <table style="border:0px;margin:0 auto;text-align:center;font-size:9pt;">

    </tr>
  </table>
  </p>

  <h2>4. UtilityTest</h2>
  <p>This Software was written by Jordi Cabot Sagrera. It is an example
   	  how to use the Class Utility which provides some helper methods. Take a
   	  look at the classes UtilityTest and Utility if you plan to work directly on the
   	  repository. It is a text-based application, which uses the CarWorld-Model
   	  in /resources/PoseidonProjects.</p>

  <h2>5. Transformation Framework</h2>
  <p>This Software was written by Christian Wende for his student research project
   	  (Gro&szlig;er Beleg). It provides a framework to implement, manage, configure and
   	  execute metamodel based transformations.
   	  The distribution comes with an implementation of transformations performing
   	  a database-shema generation from uml models.
  <table style="border:0px;margin:0 auto;text-align:center;font-size:9pt;">
  	<tr>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/transform/01.gif"><img src="images/screens/transform/01small.gif" alt="model selection" target="e"/></a></td>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/transform/02.gif"><img src="images/screens/transform/02small.gif" alt="transformation" target="e"/></a></td>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/transform/03.gif"><img src="images/screens/transform/03small.gif" alt="transformation configuration" target="e"/></a></td>
    	<td><a href="images/screens/transform/04.gif"><img src="images/screens/transform/04small.gif" alt="transformation result" target="e"/></a></td>
    </tr><tr>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Model selection</td>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Transformation</td>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Transformation configuration</td>
	    <td width="180" style="vertical-align:top;">Transformation result</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </p>

  <h2>6. Eclipse Plugins</h2>
  <p> There are three Eclipse plugins shipped with this Toolkit. The Base plugin and
      the OCL Editor plugin were written by Mirko St&ouml;lzel. The Visualization plugin
      was written by Kai-Uwe G&auml;rtner.
      The OCL Editor plugin provides a text editor for OCL Constraints.
      The Visualization plugin helps to see what is inside the Netbeans Repository.
      The Base plugin provides the basic functions of the Toolkit to other plugins.</p>

  <h2>7. Java Code Generator GUI</h2>
  <p>This software was written by Ronny Brandt for his student research project
      (Gro&szlig;er Beleg). It is an extension of the code generator written by
      Stefan Ocke. With this software you can load UML-models provided as XMI files
      and OCL-constraints and generate java code to check these constraints at runtime.
      This generated code also can be injected in existing java files (instrumentation)
      and they can be reverse engineered too.</p>
