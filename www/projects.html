       <h2>nxCom</h2>

<p>nxCom is a commercial product providing a business directory service.
During the development of the nxCom business logic module the OCL2Java 
and the OCLInjector4Java tool were tested (see Ralf Wiebicke's
<a href="http://rw7.de/ralf/diplom00/intro.html">diploma thesis</a>
for more information). The nxCom module was instrumented with Java code that checks
invariants (mainly business rules) against test data. Many constraint violations
could be detected in that way.</p>


      <h2>Entre2Mers</h2>


<p>Entre2Mers was a project of the <a href="http://www.edf.fr">Electricite de France</a> (EDF).
In a EDF data warehouse, many historical databases should be reconstituted.
This issue raises database quality problems of different categories like
different name and addresses of the same person in different databases.
In order to gain more confidence in information contained in relational 
databases, a database quality analysis tool was developed.</p>

<p>After experiments with an own language, OCL was used to express the 
constraints. In order to implement it, the OCL2SQL module was integrated into the EDF 
database quality tool.</p>


     <h2>JEFF</h2>

<p>JEFF is a framework for building business applications developed 
by <a href="http://www.sdm.de">sd&amp;m</a>. OCL was used to specify constraints
(both invariants and pre and post conditions) on JEFF classes and 
components.
Although the complexity of such specifications can grow very rapidly,
it is possible that a (right) use of OCL can increase the quality of code
and the performance of the software development process.
Note that the JEFF specification is based on OCL 2.0 and thus could
not yet be checked with Dresden OCL Toolkit modules.</p>
