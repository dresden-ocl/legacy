      <h2>Entre2Mers</h2>


<p>Entre2Mers was a project of the <a href="http://www.edf.fr">Electricite de France</a> (EDF).
In a EDF data warehouse, many historical databases should be reconstituted.
This issue raises database quality problems of different categories like
different name and addresses of the same person in different databases.
In order to gain more confidence in information contained in relational
databases, a database quality analysis tool was developed.</p>

<p>After experiments with an own language, OCL was used to express the
constraints. In order to implement it, the OCL2SQL module was integrated into the EDF
database quality tool.</p>


     <h2>JEFF</h2>

<p>JEFF is a framework for building business applications developed
by <a href="http://www.sdm.de">sd&amp;m</a>. OCL was used to specify constraints
(both invariants and pre and post conditions) on JEFF classes and
components.
Although the complexity of such specifications can grow very rapidly,
it is possible that a (right) use of OCL can increase the quality of code
and the performance of the software development process.
Note that the JEFF specification is based on OCL 2.0 and thus could
not yet be checked with Dresden OCL Toolkit modules.</p>



       <h2>KeY Project</h2>

<p>The aim of the <a href="http://www.key-project.org/" target="blank">KeY Project</a>
is to integrate formal software specification and verification into the industrial software
engineering processes. The starting point is a commercial CASE tool, which is augmented by
capabilities for formal specification and verification. The ultimate goal is to make the
verification process transparent for the user with respect to the informal object-oriented model.
</p>
<p>KeY uses a modified version of the OCL Parser which is part of the Dresden OCL Toolkit.
</p>



       <h2>nxCom</h2>

<p>nxCom is a commercial product providing a business directory service.
During the development of the nxCom business logic module the OCL2Java
and the OCLInjector4Java tool were tested (see Ralf Wiebicke's
<a href="http://rw7.de/ralf/diplom00/intro.html">diploma thesis</a>
for more information). The nxCom module was instrumented with Java code that checks
invariants (mainly business rules) against test data. Many constraint violations
could be detected in that way.</p>



	<h2>Spatial OCL</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.cemagref.fr/English/" target="blank">Cemagref (Agricultural and environmental engineering research)</a> develops environmental
and agricultural  databases. That way the institute implemented  a checking mechanism for
spatial constraints based on a specific extension of the OCL2SQL module ("Spatial OCL").
This extension has been used to produce automatically Oracle Spatial SQL queries from spatial
constraints. Several queries have been generated and have
been used to check the consistency of an agricultural database for organic sewage management.
