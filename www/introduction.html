<h2>Modules of the Dresden OCL Toolkit 2.0</h2>
<p>The Dresden OCL Toolkit for OCL2.0 currently consists of the following elements:</p>

<h3>Common OCL Metamodel</h3>
<p>The whole toolkit is metamodel-based and relies on a common metamodel derived
from the MOF14 and UML15 metamodels.</p>

<h3>Metadata Repository (MDR)</h3>
<p>All models and metamodels (MOF14, UML15 and our common OCL metamodel) are
stored in a metadata repository. We use NetBeans'
<a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">metadata repository implementation</a>.</p>

<h3>JMI-based (meta-) model API</h3>
<p>Using the MDR and our metamodels, we are able to generate Java interfaces for
accessing models in the MDR.</p>

<h3>OCL Standard Library</h3>
<p>We adapted our well proven "OCL-Basisbibliothek" by Frank Finger to fit the new,
metamodel-based architecture.</p>

<h3>OCL2.0 Parser</h3>
<p>Our OCL2.0 parser is based on a tailored, hand-optimized L-attributed grammar
of OCL2.0. We feed it to an enhanced version of the popular LALR(1) parser generator
<a href="http://www.sablecc.org/">SableCC</a> to create lexer, syntax analyzer
("parser") and an abstract attribute evaluator skeleton. The implementation class
of the attribute evaluator is derived from the abstract skeleton by inheritance.</p>

<p>The parser uses two passes. Pass one creates a concrete syntax tree from the
textual constraint. During pass two, the attribute evaluator performs the
transformation from CST to AST.</p>

<h3>Code generator/constraint evaluator</h3>
<p>The OCL 2.0 workbench is a demo application which allows you to load MOF14 based
models, create constraints over these models, generate code for them and evaluate
the constraints in the context of a concrete model (M1)</p>

<h3>OCL2.0 parser GUI</h3>
<p>This demo application shows the OCL2.0 parser in action. It allows you to load or
edit textual OCL constraints, load UML15 models through XMI import and parse the
constraints in the context of the model loaded. After parsing, the constraints will
be attached to their contextual model elements and you can export the enhanced
model using XMI export.</p>
