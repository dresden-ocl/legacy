<h3>2007/05/30 - New infrastucture for the Dresden OCL2 Toolkit</h3>

<p>With the publication of Matthias Br&auml;uer's Gro&szlig;er Beleg 
<a href="publications.html#gbbraeuer">"Design and
Prototypical Implementation of a Pivot Model as Exchange Format for
Models and Metamodels in a QVT/OCL Development Environment"</a> a new
milestone in the development of the Dresden OCL2 Toolkit was reached.</p>

<p>Matthias Br&auml;uer developed a new infrastructure for the toolkit based on a so-called pivot model
as exchange format for models and metamodels.<br/>
The aim of this new pivotal metamodel is to provide an abstraction
to evaluate OCL queries over instances of arbitrary domain-specific languages (including MOF and UML).
Furthermore, we support multiple repositories such as EMF besides the currently used repository Netbeans MDR.
As a first milestone Matthias Br&auml;uer used in his implementation of the pivot model the Eclipse
Modeling Framework (EMF) as its technological basis.</p>

<p>At present Ronny Brandt is working on an OCL2 interpreter based on
the new pivot model implementation. He already implemented the pivot model based on the Netbeans MDR.
A new version of the Dresden OCL2 Toolkit will be released, when Ronny Brandt has finished his 
diploma thesis.</p>

<h3>2007/03/28 - Version 1.2 of Dresden OCL2 Toolkit released</h3>

<p>A new version of the Dresden OCL2 Toolkit was released. The new version
contains a new software written by Ronny Brandt. It is an extension of the 
code generator written with which you can load UML-models provided as XMI 
files and OCL-constraints and generate java code to check these constraints
at runtime. This generated code also can be injected in existing java files 
(instrumentation) and they can be reverse engineered too.<br/>
The new version of the Dresden OCL2 Toolkit is
available from the project download area at Sourceforge:
