Royal and Loyal Constraint Extension
====================================
This project extends the "royal and loyal" example provided in the plug-in 
tudresden.ocl20.pivot.examples.royalsandloyals.

It contains JUnit test suite to test the generated code for the OCL expressions 
provided with the "royal and loyal" example. 

If you want to execute these JUnit
tests successfully, you have to generate the AspectJ code for the constraints 
first!

If you import this project from a jar file, please note that this project has
a dependency to the plug-in tudresden.ocl20.pivot.examples.royalandloyal.
You have to import this plug-in as a library or you have reference its content
to execute the test suite successfully.


This is an AspectJ project!
===========================
Please note that this project uses AspectJ to be executed successfully. 
To run AspectJ with Eclipse, the AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT) must
be installed and the project must be converted into an AJDT project
(e.g. via context menu in the package explorer)

The AJDT can be found at http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/
