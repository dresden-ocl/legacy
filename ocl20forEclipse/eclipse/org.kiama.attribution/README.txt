This plug-in is the OSGi version of the kiama library, version 0.9 that depends on Scala 2.7.7.
It has been slightly modified (method setChildConnections was made protected to override it) to
build a technological bridge to Ecore models.

Be aware: In order to build the plug-in you need the Scala IDE for Eclipse 
	(update site: http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin).
	The plug-in already contains the built code (bin-folder), so if you do not want
	to change anything, you can work with it right away.
