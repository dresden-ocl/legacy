Royals and Loyals 
================= 

This is the famous "Royals and Loyals" example. It is based on the
model published on page 22 in [1]. The constraints are partly based on
the constraints from the book, partly on the constraints that were
developed for the corresponding example of the Octopus distribution
[2] and some are were also developed by our own.

The example exists out of three files:
- royals_and_loyals.txt:   This text file.
- royals_and_loyals.zargo: The model in ArgoUML [3] format. You need 
                           at least version 0.20.alpha1 of ArgoUML. 
                           This file can directly be used together 
 			   with the OCL parser GUI and CLI, i.e. you 
			   do not need to export an XMI file..
- royals_and_loyals.ocl:   The OCL specification of "Royals and
                           Loyals". The specification as whole is not 
                           meaningful (i.e. it is inconsistent), but it
                           shows many different OCL constraints.
