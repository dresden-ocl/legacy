This document contains the documentation of \acl{DOT4Eclipse}. In the first Chapter the general use of \acl{DOT4Eclipse} and its installation will be explained. Afterwards, use cases like \acs{OCL} interpretation and code generation will be explained.

Please be aware, that \acl{DOT4Eclipse} is a project at the Software Technology Group, University of Dresden, that is realized and developed during student theses. Some parts have been developed as prototype. Thus, the toolkit is far from being complete. To report bugs and errors or request additional features or answers to specific questions visit our project site at Sourceforge \cite{WWW:toolkitSourceforge} or visit our toolkit website \cite{WWW:toolkit}.

The procedure described in this manual has been realized and tested with \keyword{Eclipse 3.5} \cite{WWW:eclipse}. We recommend to use the \keyword{Eclipse Modeling Tools Edition} which contains all required plug-ins to run \acl{DOT4Eclipse}. Otherwise you need to install at least the plug-ins enlisted in Table \ref{tab:software}.
