This document contains the documentation of \acl{DOT4Eclipse}. In the first Chapter the general use of \acl{DOT4Eclipse} and its installation is explained. Afterwards, use cases like \acs{OCL} interpretation and code generation are presented.

Please be aware, that \acl{DOT4Eclipse} is a project at the Technische Universität Dresden, Software Technology Group. Parts of the project have been realized and developed during student theses and have been developed as prototypes only. Thus, the toolkit is far from being complete. To report bugs and errors or request additional features or answers to specific questions visit our project site at \keyword{Sourceforge} \cite{WWW:toolkitSourceforge} or visit our toolkit website \cite{WWW:toolkit}.

The procedure described in this manual has been realized and tested with \keyword{Eclipse 3.5} \cite{WWW:eclipse}. We recommend to use the \keyword{Eclipse Modeling Tools Edition} which contains all required plug-ins to run \acl{DOT4Eclipse}\footnote{Apart from the \acs{AJDT} that are required by some example plug-ins.}. Otherwise you need to install at least the plug-ins enlisted in Table \ref{tab:software}.
