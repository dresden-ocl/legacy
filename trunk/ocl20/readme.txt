To compile and run, you need the following in your classpath:

src;
res\generatedJMI;
res;
lib\ocl20jmiapi.jar;

furthermore, the Netbeans Metadata Repository jars 
(Please downlowd them from mdr.netbeans.org and put them into the lib folder):

lib\openide.jar;
lib\jmi.jar;
lib\jmiutils.jar;
lib\mdrapi.jar;lib\mof.jar;
lib\nbmdr.jar;



and the tools.jar coming with the JDK:

$jdklocation\lib\tools.jar


The folder resources\generatedJMI contains the source code of the generated JMI interfaces.
In case of changes in the metamodel they can be re-generated by calling tudresden.ocl20.MetaModelIntegrator.
To use them, compile them and create a new ocl20jmiapi.jar from them.
