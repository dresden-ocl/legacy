Please copy it from 
$java-home\lib\tools.jar
to the lib directory or edit the classpath in the start script to include it. 


The folder resources\generatedJMI contains the source code of the generated JMI interfaces.
In case of changes in the metamodel they can be re-generated by calling tudresden.ocl20.MetaModelIntegrator.
