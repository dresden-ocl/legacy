Refactoring from AllExpressionsTest

Add to general test suite?
    
StandardLibrary:
================
False IMPLIES anything is True, anything IMPLIES True is True

The IF-expression is another exception. It will be valid as long as 
the chosen branch is valid, irrespective of the value of the other branch.
OclVoid = object is true, if object is undefined (Spec 2.1 p. 140)
OclInvalid = object is true, if object is invalid (Spec 2.1 p. 140)
Collection->isEmpty(): null->isEmpty() returns true! (Spec 2.1 p. 150)
Collection->notEmpty(): null->notEmpty() returns false! (Spec 2.1 p. 150)
