<h1>Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse - An introduction</h1>

<!--#include virtual="_menu.html" -->

<h2>What is the Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse?</h2>

<p>The Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse is the newest version of the
Dresden OCL2 Toolkit which is based on the Eclipse SDK.</p>

<p>The Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse is based on the so-called
pivot model as exchange format for models and meta models developed by
Matthias Br&auml;uer. The aim of this new pivotal meta model is to
provide an abstraction to evaluate OCL queries over instances of
arbitrary domain-specific languages (including MOF and UML).
Furthermore, we support multiple repositories such as EMF besides the
currently used repository Netbeans MDR. The implementation of the pivot
model is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).</p>

<h2>The tools of the Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse</h2>

<p>The new toolkit contains an OCL2 Parser developed by Nils Thieme
and an OCL2 Interpreter developed by Ronny Brandt. A third tool which
enables the generations of pivot model adapters, to adapt the pivot
model to new repositories is also included into the Toolkit and was
developed by Michael Thiele.</p>

<h2>Getting started with the Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse</h2>

<p>The Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse is built as a set of Eclipse
plugins. <a href="4eclipse_usage.html">How to install the plugins
and getting startet with the toolkit is explained in the usage examples
section.</a></p>
