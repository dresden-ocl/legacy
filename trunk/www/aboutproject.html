       <h2>What is the Dresden OCL Toolkit?</h2>

<p>The Dresden OCL Toolkit is all about the Object Constraint Language (OCL). OCL is
part of the well-known Unified Modelling Language (UML). It extends the UML's graphical
notation with the possiblity of adding more formally defined textual constraints on method
invocations and on class structures as a whole. Many aspects
of a model that cannot be expressed adequately with the graphical notation alone find
their representation in OCL constraints.</p>

<p>So, where does the Dresden OCL Toolset come into play? As its name indicates it is
not some standalone solution. Instead, many of these tools are meant to be used as a library,
integrated into other tools, but there exist also some standalone tools in the toolkit.</p>

       <h2>Who did the work?</h2>

<p>Work on the Toolkit started as early as 1999 when the OCL base library was
first implemented in Java. Since the first version of the OCL compiler was
completed alongside a Diploma Thesis, continuous work on and around the Toolkit has
led to quite a considerable number of modules, which are now available.</p>

<p>The toolkit is enhanced and maintained mainly by students and scientific staff
of the Software Engineering Group at Technische Universität Dresden, where the
project is also coordinated. Contribution is however not restricted to this group
so feel free to get in touch.</p>

       <h2>Some inspirational screenshots</h2>

<p>Although this is not a stand-alone tool there is a demonstration
module coming with the Toolkit which helps to understand the way the Toolkit works.
