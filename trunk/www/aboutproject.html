<h1>About the project</h1>

<h2>What is the Dresden OCL Toolkit?</h2>

<p>The Dresden OCL Toolkit is all about the Object Constraint
Language (OCL). OCL is part of the well-known Unified Modeling Language
(UML). It extends the UML's graphical notation with the possibility of
adding more formally defined textual constraints on method invocations
and on class structures as a whole. Many aspects of a model that cannot
be expressed adequately with the graphical notation alone find their
representation in OCL constraints.</p>

<p>So, where does the Dresden OCL Toolkit come into play? As its
name indicates it is not some stand-alone solution. Instead, many of
these tools are meant to be used as a library, integrated into other
tools, but there exist also some stand-alone tools in the toolkit.</p>

<h2>Who did the work?</h2>

<p>Work on the toolkit started as early as 1999 when the OCL base
library was first implemented in Java. Since the first version of the
OCL compiler was completed alongside a Diploma Thesis, continuous work
on and around the Toolkit has led to quite a considerable number of
modules, which are now available.</p>

<p>The Toolkit is enhanced and maintained mainly by students and
scientific staff of the Software Technology Group at Technische
Universit&auml;t Dresden, where the project is also coordinated.
Contribution is however not restricted to this group so feel free to get
in touch.</p>

<h2>The different versions of the toolkit</h2>

<p>The toolkit was published in three different versions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first version, the <strong>Dresden OCL Toolkit</strong> is
	out of date by now and thus not documented at this web site.</li>
	<li>The second version, called the <strong>Dresden OCL2
	Toolkit</strong> is based on the Netbeans Metadata Repository and contains a lot
	of different tools. <a href="ocl2_intro.html">More information
	about the Dresden OCL2 Toolkit can be found via this link.</a></li>
	<li>The third and last version of the Toolkit is the <strong>Dresden
	OCL2 Toolkit for Eclipse</strong>. The Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse is based
	on a Pivot Model and thus can be connected to any data repository. The
	Dresden Toolkit for Eclipse is based on the Eclispe SDK. <a
		href="4eclipse_intro.html">More information about the Dresden OCL2
	Toolkit for Eclipse is available via this link.</a></li>
</ul>
