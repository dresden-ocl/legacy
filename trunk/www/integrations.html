<h2>HOL-OCL</h2>

<p>HOL-OCL is an interactive proof environment for the Object Constraint Language (OCL).
  It is implemented as a shallow embedding of OCL into the Higher-order Logic (HOL) instance
  of the interactive theorem prover Isabelle. HOL-OCL is developed by Achim D. Brucker and
  Burkhart Wolff.</p>
  
<p>HOL-OCL defines a machine-checked formalization of the semantics as described in the 
  standard for OCL 2.0. This conservative, shallow embedding of UML/OCL into Isabelle/HOL 
  includes support for typed, extensible UML data models supporting inheritance and subtyping
  inside the typed &lambda;-calculus with parametric polymorphism. As a consequence of
  conservativity with respect to higher-order logic (HOL), we can guarantee the consistency
  of the semantic model.  Moreover,  HOL-OCL provides several derived calculi for UML/OCL
  that allows for formal derivations establishing the validity of UML/OCL formulae. 
  Automated support for such proofs is also provided.</p>
  
<p>HOL-OCL uses the Dresden OCL Toolkit as repository and the OCL2-Parser for type 
  checking.</p>

<h2>Incremental OCL</h2>

<p>Incremental OCL is a prototype tool that assist you in the efficient implementation 
  of OCL constraints in any final technology-platform.</p>
<p> It gives you information about the kind of changes over the system state that can 
  violate a constraint, the instances must be verified after each change and possible 
  redefinitions of the original constraint that result in a better efficiency of the integrity
  checking process.</p>
<p>The tool is implemented as a set of Java classes extended with the libraries of the
  Dresden OCL toolkit (for parsing and loading the OCL ICs) and NetBeans MDR 
  (for the import/export from XMI files).</p>
<p>More information in: <a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~jcabot/research/IncrementalOCL/" 
  target="blank">http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~jcabot/research/IncrementalOCL/</a>.</p>


<h2>OCL Transformation Tool</h2>

<p>Due to the high expressiveness of the OCL, the designer has different syntactic alternatives
  to express each constraint. This tool assists the designer during the definition of the 
  constraints by means of generating equivalent alternatives for the initially defined ones.</p>
<p>In the context of the MDA, transformations between these different alternatives are required
  as part of the PIM-to-PIM, PIM-to-PSM or PIM-to-code transformations of the original conceptual
  schema.</p>
<p>Specially, the OCL Transformation Tool is able to generate all alternative equivalent 
  representations of a constraint obtained by means of  changing the context type used to define 
  the original constraint.</p>
<p>The OCL Transformation Tool uses the Dresden OCL Toolkit to parse constraints for which the
  tool generates all possible context changes.</p>

<h2>UMLtoCSP</h2>

<p>UMLtoCSP is a tool for the formal verification of UML/OCL models using Constraint Programming. 
  It can check automatically several correctness properties about the model, such as the 
  satisfiability of the model or the lack of contradictory constraints.</p>
<p>UMLtoCSP uses the Dresden OCL Toolkit to parse and load OCL constraints.</p>

<h2>Fujaba4Eclipse</h2>

<p>The Fujaba Tool Suite is developed at the university of Paderborn
(<a	href="http://wwwcs.uni-paderborn.de/cs/fujaba/projects/eclipse/index.html"
	target="blank">http://wwwcs.uni-paderborn.de/cs/fujaba/projects/eclipse/index.html</a>).
One project based on the Fujaba Tool Suite is Fujaba4Eclipse.
Fujaba4Eclipse is as an open source project and its goal is to provide
an integrated teaching environment based on Eclipse for secondary
schools and first year university courses. It should assist teaching
object-oriented technology, design patterns and the syntax and semantics
of a programming language.</p>
<p>In 2005 and 2006 Mirko St&ouml;lzel integrated parts of the
Dresden OCL2 Toolkit into Fujaba4Eclipse (for his student research
projects Gro&szlig;er Beleg and Diploma Thesis), to use OCL constraints
in class and story diagrams created with Fujaba4Eclipse.</p>


<h2>ArgoUML</h2>

<p>The Dresden OCL Toolkit has been integrated into the open-source
CASE tool <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/">ArgoUML</a>. Please have
a look on <a href="ocl_argoIntegration.html">an example that shows
how the integration in Argo/UML helps in working with the OCL</a>. The
example also shows the code injection with the injector tool from the
toolkit. If you want to test the example by yourself, please refer to
the download page and install the necessary files.</p>


<h2>Borland Together</h2>

<p>A prototypical integration into <a
	href="http://www.borland.de/together/index.html">Borland Together
ControlCenter</a> is available (see <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=5840">screenshot</a>).
It is currently only available through downloading the sources from the
CVS repository and building the module manually with the help of ANT
scripts. Please refer to the installation <a
	href="ocl_togetherIntegration.html">step-by-step guide</a> provided.</p>

<p>Also have a look on this <a
	href="ocl_togetherIntegrationUsageExample.html">usage example</a> that
shows how the Toolkit can be used from within Together.</p>

<p>The integration of the Dresden OCL Toolkit 1.3 into Borland
Together ControlCenter should work with all versions vom 6.0 upwards.</p>


<h2>MetaBoss</h2>

<p><a href="http://metaboss.sourceforge.net/">MetaBoss</a>, a dually
licensed Model-Driven-Architecture toolkit makes use of the Dresden OCL
Toolkit for modelling of service specifications and domain entities. It
also allows generation of validation code from the OCL in a model.</p>



<h2>Poseidon</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gentleware.com">Poseidon</a> is the
commercial successor of ArgoUML and also contains the integration of the
Dresden OCL Toolkit just as its predecessor does.</p>


<h2>Rational Rose</h2>

<p>An integration into Rational Rose has been performed. This
integration package is not in the public domain, however.</p>
