Changes to current CVS
======================

Changes that could break older environments
-------------------------------------------

Other changes
-------------
* [Build System] Added this file together with a release policy.
                 Therefore, this section is by no means complete.

* [Type Checker] Introduced Type2


Fixed bugs
----------
* [Injector]     #223601 static initializers
  [OCL Library]  replaced Class.forName(name) by
  [Type Checker] Class.forName(name, false, getClass().getClassLoader())
                 This prevents static initializers from being executed
                 which caused trouble for some people.



POLICY FOR CHANGELOG
====================

1) Entries are sorted in reversed temporal order, this means, the lastest
   entry in on top.

2) No tabulators at all.

3) To identify modules use the list of categories from the project's
   bugzilla. Up to now, these are:

     Build System
     Injector
     Java Code Generator
     Java OCL Library
     Normalizers
     Parser
     Type Checker
     Website

   Please send proposals for new categories to dresden-ocl-discussion.
