<p>This package constitutes the OCL Class Library. The library uses the Java 2
collection framework and therefore cannot be used with JDK 1.1.

<h3>Intention</h3>

This class library is intended to be used in a OCL to Java generator. The
Java source code produced by this utility consists to a large part of calls
to this library. A primary goal in the design of the library is therefore to faciliate
code generation. This is done be making the generation process as far as possible
independent of model information (except, of course, for the OCL expression itself). 

<p>To derive Java source code from the OCL expression, all type information has to
extracted from the operations of the expression. Some interfaces, like 
OclSubtractable, were introduced to support this.

<p>The following class diagrams 
should give a basic idea of the design. The diagrams are produced with the open-source
case tool <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/arch/uml">Argo/UML</a>, that was also
used for code sceleton generation.

<p>This diagram shows <a href="OclRoot.html">OclRoot</a>, the root 
interface of the class library, and the classes 
implementing it directly. All classes of the library that represent predefined OCL 
types implement OclRoot.

<p>OCL data types are the basic types (above), application-specific types (below) and 
collection types.

<p>The Collection-Related Types are a central part of OCL predefined classes. The 
classes that represent them in the class library are shown in the diagram above. 
<p>The diagram below shown classes necessary to implement the "iterating methods" 
(i.e. methods having an OCL expression as argument) of OCL.

<p>The class <CODE>Ocl</CODE> provides class methods that access a factory class to generate OCL 
class library representations for application objects and values (e.g. 
OclInteger for int, OclAny for application classes, OclSet for application 
collections).
Similar plug-in objects are used to make the library adaptable to a code
generators schemes for state diagram representation and to name conversions.
