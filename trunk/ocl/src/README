2. CHECK IN POLICY
------------------

All the rules below are valid regardless whether a conflict is
caused by a bug in one of the tools. If a conflict really
causes pain, I may decide to upgrade the version of the tool.

No one gets hung, when violating the rules (I even did this
myself). You'll get a friendly email.

2.1 Compile
-----------
Every .java file in the repository must compile with

  jikes Version 1.06 (17 Sep 99)
  AND
  javac of the SUN JDK java version "1.2.2"
  AND
  any later version of the above.

EXCEPTION:
jikes 1.12 terminates with a failing assertion, the rule above
does not apply to this version of jikes. Version 1.06 is known
to work.

2.2 Ant
-------
Ant must build successfully with the build.xml in this directory.
Besides compiling jar-files are created and checked for static
closure.
Note, that the build.xml does not compile all classes.

2.3 Javadoc
-----------
javadoc run with the file "jdoc" in this directory must
not produce any warnings, when using

  java version "1.2.2"
  AND
  any later version of the above.

2.4 Test Suites
---------------

Skripts regress.sh and injectionsuite in this directory
must run through without exceptions. These skripts require
GNU diff and a UNIX compatible shell.

2.5 Tabs
--------
You are free to use tabs for identing or not. If you do, a single
tab is exactly ONE level of identation.
You may mix tabs and spaces within a file, but then tab width is 2,
in words "two".
