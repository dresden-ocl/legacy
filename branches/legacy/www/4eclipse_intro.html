<!--#include virtual="_menu.html" -->

<h2>What Dresden OCL2 for Eclipse?</h2>

<p>Dresden OCL2 for Eclipse is the newest version of the
Dresden OCL Toolkit which is based on the Eclipse SDK.</p>

<p>Dresden OCL2 for Eclipse is based on the so-called
pivot model as exchange format for models and meta models developed by
Matthias Br&auml;uer. The aim of this new pivotal meta model is to
provide an abstraction to evaluate OCL queries over instances of
arbitrary domain-specific languages (including MOF and UML).
Furthermore, we support multiple repositories such as EMF besides the
currently used repository Netbeans MDR. The implementation of the pivot
model is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).</p>

<h2>The tools of the Dresden OCL2 for Eclipse</h2>

<p>Dresden OCL2 for Eclipse contains:
<ul>
  <li>The pivot model infrastructure developed by Matthias Br&auml;uer which enables
    the user to connect the toolkit with any repository and meta model he wants.
    By now, MOF1.4 and UML1.5 with Netbeans MDR, UML2.0 with Eclipse UML and PML
    models are supported.</li>
  <li>An OCL2 Parser developed by Nils Thieme.</li>
  <li>An OCL2 Interpreter developed by Ronny Brandt.</li>
  <li>A Java Code Generator developed by Claas Wilke.</li>
</ul>
