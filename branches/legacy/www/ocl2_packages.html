<!--#include virtual="_menu.html" -->

<h2>Packages and Tools of the Dresden OCL2 Toolkit</h2>
<p>This page will explain the different packages of the Dresden OCL2
Toolkit.</p>
<p>The Dresden OCL2 Toolkit is currently divided into the following
parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The MDR repository</li>
	<li>base tools</li>
	<li>tools working on the base tools</li>
	<li>end user tools</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>Metadata Repository (MDR)</h2>
<p>The whole toolkit is metamodel-based and relies on a common
metamodel derived from the MOF14 and UML15 metamodels.</p>
<p>All models and metamodels (MOF14, UML15 and our common OCL
metamodel) are stored in a metadata repository. We use NetBeans' <a
	href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">metadata repository implementation</a>.</p>
<p>Using the MDR and our metamodels, we are able to generate Java
interfaces for accessing models in the MDR.</p>

<h2>The base tools</h2>

<h3>OCL2 Parser</h3>
<p>Our OCL2 Parser written by Ansgar Konermann is based on a
tailored, hand-optimized L-attributed grammar of OCL2.0. We feed it to
an enhanced version of the popular LALR(1) parser generator <a
	href="http://www.sablecc.org/">SableCC</a> to create lexer, syntax
analyzer ("parser") and an abstract attribute evaluator skeleton. The
implementation class of the attribute evaluator is derived from the
abstract skeleton by inheritance.</p>
<p>The parser uses two passes. Pass one creates a concrete syntax
tree from the textual constraint. During pass two, the attribute
evaluator performs the transformation from CST to AST.</p>

<h3>OCL Base Library</h3>
<p>We adapted our well proven "OCL-Basisbibliothek" by Frank Finger
to fit the new, metamodel-based architecture.</p>

<h3>Code generator/constraint evaluator</h3>
<p>The Code Generator developed by Stefan Ocke and adapted by
Florian Heidenreich is an abstraction of multiple general template
engines (as StringTemplate) helpful for the reuse by the Transformation
Framework and the OCL Declarative Code Generator.</p>

<h2>Tools working with base tools</h2>

<h3>OCL Editor</h3>
<p>The OCL Editor plugin provides a text editor for OCL Constraints.
The editor was developed by Steffen Zschaler and adapted as an Eclipse
plugin by Mirko St&ouml;lzel.</p>

<h3>OCL Declarative Code Generator</h3>
<p>The Declarative Code Generator written by Florian Heidenreich
generates declarative target code for a given expression in OCL. The
Declarative Code Generator is used by the OCL22SQL tool.</p>

<h2>End user tools</h2>

<h3>OCL Fujaba4Eclipse</h3>

<p>The Fujaba Tool Suite is developed at the university of paderborn
(<a
	href="http://wwwcs.uni-paderborn.de/cs/fujaba/projects/eclipse/index.html"
	target="blank">http://wwwcs.uni-paderborn.de/cs/fujaba/projects/eclipse/index.html</a>).
One project based on the Fujaba Tool Suite is Fujaba4Eclipse.
Fujaba4Eclipse is as an open source project and its goal is to provide
an integrated teaching environment based on Eclipse for secondary
schools and first year university courses. It should assist teaching
object-oriented technology, design patterns and the syntax and semantics
of a programming language.</p>
<p>In 2005 and 2006 Mirko St&ouml;lzel integrated parts of the
Dresden OCL2 Toolkit into Fujaba4Eclipse (for his student research
projects Gro&szlig;er Beleg and Diploma Thesis), to use OCL constraints
in class and story diagrams created with Fujaba4Eclipse.</p>

<h3>OCL2 Parser GUI</h3>
<p>This demo application written by Ansgar Konermann shows the OCL2
Parser in action. It allows you to load or edit textual OCL constraints,
load UML1.5 ord MOF1.4 models through XMI import and parse the
constraints in the context of the model loaded. After parsing, the
constraints will be attached to their contextual model elements and you
can export the enhanced model using XMI export.</p>

<h3>OCL22Java</h3>
<p>The OCL22Java tool written generates Java code out of OCL
expressions as well as instruments Java programs with the generated
code. The tool was developed by Ralf Wiebicke and adapted for the
Dresden OCL2 Toolkit by Ronny Brandt.</p>

<h3>OCL2 Workbench</h3>
<p>The the OCL2 Workbench written by Stefan Ocke allows you to
evaluate constraints in the context of a concrete model (M1) and to
generate Java code.</p>

<h3>Model visualization</h3>
<p>The model visualization written by Uwe G&auml;rtner helps to see what
is inside the Netbeans Repository.</p>

<h3>Transformation Framework</h3>
<p>This Software was written by Christian Wende for his student
research project (Gro&szlig;er Beleg). It provides a framework to
implement, manage, configure and execute metamodel based
transformations. The distribution comes with a implementation of
transformations performing a database-schema generation from uml models.</p>

<h3>OCL22SQL</h3>
<p>This software was written as a prototype example for the
DeclarativeCode-Generator by Florian Heidenreich for his diploma thesis
(The first version of the tool (OCL2SQL) was developed by Sten
L&ouml;cher). It generates SQL code to create integrity views from a
given UML1.5 model and textual OCL invariants.</p>
