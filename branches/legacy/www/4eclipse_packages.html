<h2>Packages and Tools of Dresden OCL2 for Eclipse</h2>
<p>This page will explain the different packages of Dresden OCL2 for
 Eclipse.</p>
 
<p>Dresden OCL2 for Eclipse is currently divided into the following
parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Back-Ende</li>
	<li>The Toolkit Basis</li>
	<li>The Tools</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Back-End</h2>

<p>The Back-End of the Toolkit is a meta model which can be used to
 load models and Constraints into the Toolkit. Thanks to the Pivot Model
 developed by Matthias Br&auml;uer, the
 Toolkit is totally independent of a specific meta model or 
 repository. The Toolkit can be connected with any meta model which
 can be adapted to the Pivot Model. Thus the meta model is 
 exchangeable.</p>


<h2>The Toolkit Basis</h2>

<p>The Toolkit Basis can be separated into three packages developed by
 Matthias Br&auml;uer which provide all functionality to load models,
 constraints and model instances into the Toolkit.</p>

<h3>The Pivot Model</h3>
<p>The Pivot Model provides a set of Adapters which can be implemented
 to map the Toolkit to a meta model the user wants to work with in the
 Toolkit. All other tools and packages of the Toolkit are only using
 the interfaces of the Pivot Model to communicate with the currently
 selected meta model. Thus the meta model can be exchanged easily.</p>

<h3>Essential OCL</h3>
<p>The Essential OCL packages uses the Pivot Model to define a meta 
 model for OCL Constraints. Essential OCL is based on the standard
 library of OCL 2.0. Invariants, pre- and postconditions are supported.
 Furthermore, definitions, initial, body and let expressions can be
 defined.</p>

<h3>The Model Bus</h3>
<p>The Model Bus provides a meta model, model and a model instance
 registry which can be used by other packages of the Toolkit to get 
 any meta model, model or model instance which have been loaded
 into the Toolkit.</p>


<h2>The Tools</h2>

<p>By now, Dresden OCL2 for Eclipse provides three tools: An OCL2
 Parser, an OCL2 Interpreter and a OCL2 to Java Codegenerator. 

<h3>The OCL2 Parser</h3>
<p>The OCL2 Parser has been developed by Nils Thieme and can be 
 used to open text files and parse them as OCL2 constraints. The
 constraints parsed by the parser are added to the model in the 
 toolkit on which they have been defined.</p>

<h3>The OCL2 Interpreter</h3>
<p>The OCL2 Interpreter has been developed by Ronny Brandt and 
 can be used to interpret already imported OCL2 constraints.
 Invariants, pre- and postconditions can be interpreted. Initial
 and let expressions, definitions and body expressions can be used
 to enrich and prepare the OCL2 interpretation.</p>
 
 <h3>OCL2Java</h3>
 <p>OCL2Java is a code generator developed by Claas Wilke which
  can be used to generated Java code for imported OCL2 constraints.
  The code generator uses the aspect-oriented language AspectJ
  to instrument the generated code into the provided Java code
  for the imported model used for the code generation. The code
  generator supports the generation of code for invariants, pre-
  and postconditions, definitions, initial and defined values, body
  and let expressions.</p>
