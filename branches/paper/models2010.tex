\begin{abstract}
  In recent years, OCL advanced from a language used to constrain UML models to 
  a constraint language that is applied to various object-oriented modelling
  languages. This includes Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) and meta-modelling languages 
  like the Meta Object Facility (MOF) or Ecore. 
  Consequently, it is rather common to provide variability for OCL parsers to
  work with different modelling languages. 
  A second variability dimension relates to the
  infrastructure that models are realised in. 
  Current OCL interpreters do not support such variability as they are typically 
  bound to a specific realisation technique like Java, Ecore, or another
  specific model repository. In this paper we propose a generic adaptation
  architecture for OCL that hides models and model instances 
  behind well-defined interfaces. We present how the implementation of such an
  architecture for DresdenOCL enables reuse of the same 
  OCL interpreter for various model realisation techniques. Finally, our approach is evaluated in three
  case studies defining and interpreting OCL constraints on multiple models
  and model instances.
