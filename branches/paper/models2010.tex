\begin{abstract}
In recent years the Object Constraint Language (OCL) has become a popular constraint language that is used on top of multiple modeling languages such as UML, EMF Ecore and various domain specific languages. OCL is only loosely coupled to these modeling languages, it is rather common to reuse the same OCL parsers for multiple different modeling languages. Nevertheless, dynamic OCL semantics as required for OCL constraint interpretation is typically implemented in a specific programming language and thus limited to specific programming or modeling languages. In this paper, we propose an architecture for an OCL tool that encapsulates meta-models, models and model instantiations behind well-defined interfaces. We present an OCL interpreter that can interpret OCL constraints on various different model instantiations and provides reuse of the same dynamic OCL semantics implementation for all these instantiation types. The architecture is evaluated by presenting three case studies defining and interpreting OCL constraints on multiple models and model instantiations.
