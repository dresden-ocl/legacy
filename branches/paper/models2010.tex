\begin{abstract}
  In recent years, OCL advanced from a language used to constraint UML models to 
  a constraint language that is applied to various object-oriented modelling
  languages including various Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) and metamodeling languages 
  like the Meta Object Facility (MOF) or Ecore. 
  Consequently, it is rather common provide variability in OCL parsers to
  work for different modelling languages. 
  A second, variability dimension relates to the
  infrastructure that models are implemented and instantiated in. 
  Current OCL interpreters do not support such variability but are typically 
  bound to a specific implementation infrastructure, e.g. Ecore, Java, or a
  specific model repository. In this paper, we propose a generic adaptation
  architecture for OCL that hides meta-models, models and model instances 
  behind well-defined interfaces. We present how the implementation of such
  architecture for DresdenOCL enables reuse of the same 
  OCL interpreter for various model implementation and
  instantiation infrastructures. Finally, our approach is evaluated in three
  case studies defining and interpreting OCL constraints on multiple models
  and model instances.
