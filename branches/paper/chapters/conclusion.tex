\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we presented a generic approach for OCL
interpretation that addresses both model and
model instance variability. Various OCL infrastructures support 
model variability, whereas -- to the best of our knowledge -- none of 
the existing OCL infrastructure supports complete model instance
variability. Our approach addresses this problem by
abstracting from domain-specific concepts and by introducing well-defined interfaces for models
and their instances. With our implementation of such a
generic adaptation architecture, the same OCL interpreter was applied to
three case studies that are located at different mo\-del\-ling layers and
use different combinations of models and model instances. We
avoided new implementations of the OCL standard library for various different
technical spaces and hence contribute a reusable OCL interpreter.

For future work, we plan to improve our approach by addressing the issues mentioned 
in Sect.~\ref{sec:lessons}. We are interested in evaluating
the performance impact of our adapter-based approach for OCL interpretation.
Therefore, we plan a benchmark comparing our interpreter with other
interpreters and compilers, and a continuation of our previous
work~\cite{OCLRelDB} on extensible OCL compilation.
