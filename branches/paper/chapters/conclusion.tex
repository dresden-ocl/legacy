  \item Conclusion:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item exchangability
    \item execution layer can be reused as well
    \item less errors, only one implementation, well tested
  \end{itemize}  
\end{itemize}

The most important difference between Model Types and Model Instance Types
	is that Model Types abstract modelling concepts whereas Model Instance Types abstract 
	reflection capabilities of different model instances.
