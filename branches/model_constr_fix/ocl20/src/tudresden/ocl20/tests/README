How to run the tests
====================
1. Before you can run the test cases you may read the instructions in the GETTING-STARTED file in the root
   folder of this project.

2. The Test Suite is written in jUnit4. Make sure that the jUnit4 library is listed in your classpath.

3. Some of the test cases uses files located in the resources folder of the Dresden OCL2 Toolkit!
   If you run the AllTests.java, make sure, that the resources folder is listed as a library in the 
   classpath of your project!

4. Run the AllTests.java of the package tudresden.ocl2.tests as a jUnit4 Test Suite
   or call the run.tests task in the build.xml Ant script.

ATTENTION: Some test case uses the Java class FileReader which seems to have some problems with
paths containing white spaces. Make sure, that your project folder and its absolute path does not 
contain any white spaces!
