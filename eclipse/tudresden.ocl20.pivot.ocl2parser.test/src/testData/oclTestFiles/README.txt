This folder contains a set of ocl files that are
used to test the ocl parser.
All ocl constraints in the test files are taken from
the ocl book [1].
The idea was that this books covers many of the
potentiality of the ocl language. So the
hope is that these ocl expressions covers most
of the parsers functionality.
But it seems it does not. So in the next
months there will be more testcase in this package.
