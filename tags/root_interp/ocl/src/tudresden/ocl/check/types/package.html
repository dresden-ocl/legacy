The classes and interfaces in this package are used to access model information
and represent OCL types. <code>ModelFacade</code> is the interface used by the
type checker to access model information.

<p>
The following sequence diagram gives an example of how the type checker uses 
interfaces of this package to get the necessary model information to check the
constraint 
<code>context Person inv: managedCompanies.employees-&gt;includes(self)</code>.
<br/>
SomeAny and SomeModelFacade stand for implementions of the respective interfaces.
<i>setOfCompany</i> and <i>setOfPerson</i> are instances of {@link 
tudresden.ocl.check.types.Collection}.

<p>
<code>ReflectionFacade</code> is an implementation of this interface that
queries compiled Java classes via reflection to get model information.
<code>TestModelFacade</code> in the subpackage <code>testfacade</code>
is a dummy implementation that is
used for testing and demonstration purposes. Other implementations are backed
by information from XMI files or Argo/UMLs repository. (The sourcecode of the 
latter is part of Argo.)
