The OCL2.0 Toolkit depends on NetBeans MDR (http://mdr.netbeans.org/).

The JAR files in this directory contain a pre-build version of NetBeans
MDR, compiled from CVS sources of 2004-12-21. This version is known to
work with our toolkit. Other versions may also work, but are completely
untested.
