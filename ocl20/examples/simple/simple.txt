Simple
====== 

This an artificial example of a tiny model, mainly for testing 
purposes. Nevertheless, this examples seems to trigger many 
critical aspects of OCL tools and it has shown to be very useful 
in improving and developing of Dresden-OCL 2.0 [1] and HOL-OCL [2]. 


The example exists out of three files:
- simple.txt: This text file.
- simple.zargo: The model in ArgoUML [3] format. You need at least 
                version 0.20.alpha1 of ArgoUML. 
                This file can directly be used together with the 
                OCL parser GUI and CLI, i.e. you do not need to 
                export an XMI file..
- simple.ocl:   Several OCL formulae over this simple model. Their
                only purpose is to test several aspects/features
                of OCL.
